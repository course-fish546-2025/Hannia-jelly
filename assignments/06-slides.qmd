## Project Goal

I am using RNA-seq data taken from Sea Cucumbers (*Apostichopus japonicus*) that were treated under 2 different temperatures (26°C & 30°C). The purpose being to conduct DGE analysis to determine the biological responses that heat stress induces on this organism. Data was obtained from the NIH website, done by researchers in **Qingdao Agricultural University.**

## Methods: Heat stress experiment 

-   3 controls kept at 18°C

-   Six 26°C (Sub lethal temperature)

-   Three 30°C (Lethal temperature)

-   Sea cucumbers went through a temperature-rise process from 18°C to 26°C or to 30°C respectively, with a rate of 2°C per hour by using a heating rod.

-   Maintained at 26°C temperature for 6 hours and 48 hours.

-   The 30°C treatment groups were only kept at that temperature for 6 hours (likely due to lethality).

-   Intestine tissue was used for RNA-Seq

## Preliminary Results: DGE
