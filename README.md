Project goal for week 03: ID endpoint in Readme. 

My end goal for the class is to complete a differential gene analysis of sea cucumber being treated to heat stress. I will be using the readings assigned during
week 02 to as general guidence and seek help as I need it. The end product
will have a multitude of figures that display the results.
