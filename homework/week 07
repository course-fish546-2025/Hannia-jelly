Week 07 Questions

*What is your current grade in the class? How many issues are open in our research repository?

My current grade is 75%, not including the presentation grade and the final project grade. Assuming I get full points on those two, I could have 95% by the end of the quarter. 

I have 2 open issues that I need to fix. 

*Re-reading this weekâ€™s reading, what are 2 things that resonate with you now that made little practical sense in week 2. What is one aspect that you still wonder about or is unclear?

1. Under the "Sequence Read Quality and Trimming" section, the authors discuss ways to conduct quality checks of sequences in addition to the types of files used for this analysis. I now know how to conduct a QC. One thing I found interesting is that the authors write on the importance of knowing if the sequence reads are pretrimmed. I did not check if my sequences are pretrimmed and I will add this to my list of things to do for the remaining quarter. One thing that is unclear is why it is important to know if the sequences are pretrimmed, how will it impact my analysis if my sequences are not pretrimmed? 

2.Another thing that resonated with me is DGE analysis and the relavance of statistics. I created a table that has p-values and it is interesting to see the differences in p-values of my DGE analysis. 


*What is epigenetics and how could it relate to your own research project?
Epigenetics is the way in which the cell induces changes upon gene expression that are due to external/environmental or internal (physiological) changes in an organism. This changes are not within the DNA itself but rather things like transcription factors that are needed to induce the cell to express certain genes. This directly relates to my project, a heat stress experiment, because it is known that environmental stressors can induce epigenetic changes that may change the expression of genes. 

*Describe what a GFF file is?
A tab deliminated text file that has annotations of DNA or RNA sequences. These annotations show genomic features such as genes, exons, or transcripts. 

*What are two ways describing CG motifs could have value?

CG motifs are nucleotides that play a vital role in transcription and translation. They can serve as binding sites for transcription factors that aid in expressing a gene. Additionally, they can also show evolutionary patterns, how different regions of genes differ accross species for the same gene, and the importance of certain regions of genes throughout history.
