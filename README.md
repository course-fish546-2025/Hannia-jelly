## How to work in the Hannia-Jelly repo:

The files in this repo correspond to the work I completed in the FISH546 course.

The 3 main folders with relevant files are called **assignments**, **project**, & **homework**. 

-   **project**: Here you will find all of the scripts I worked on to complete my project. Additionally, you can find some of my output files. Go [here](http://rpubs.com/hannia/1318534) to access a **compendium** of my project.
-   **homework**: This folder has all of my files with answers to weekly questions. 
-   In the **assignments** folder you will find:
-   **output2**: Files that I generated from assignments. 
-   **scripts4assignments**: Here you will find completed scripts that correspond to the weekly assignments.
-   **images**:Images I created from code or imported from the internet to my repo.
