## How to work in the Hannia-Jelly repo: 

The files in this repo correspond to the work I completed in the FISH546 course.

The 2 main folders with relevant files are called **assignments** & **homework**. In the **assignments** folder, you will find 5 folders:

**data**: Data files I used to complete some of my assignments.

**images**: Images I produced from data analysis or pulled from the internet for class presentations.

**output**: Files that I generated from assingments, some of these files were created using the files in the **data** folder.

**project**: Here you will find all of the scripts I worked on to complete my project. Go [here](http://rpubs.com/hannia/1316057) to access a compendium of my project.

**scripts4assignments**: Here you will find completed scripts that correspond to the weekly assignments.
