## Week 02 Question Set

a)  **What do you feel was the most impressive thing you did in class last week was?**

The most impressive thing I did in class last week was troubleshoot my way through the BLAST assignment. Although it took me a long time, I feel good about being able to overcome a hurdle on my own.


b)  **What is your weekly goal for making progress on your project? What is the next step?**
My goal this week is to find available data through NCBI. The next step is to decide how I will be conducting an analysis. An idea I have is to take data from a research study (if avaialble to the public) that has done DGE analysis related to pollution and work through the process of analysing it using simila methods presented in class. 

c)  **There were two readings this week not from the textbook, meant for two different audiences. Which reading did you get the most out of and why? Do you have any questions regarding the Journal of Shellfish Research paper?**
Note: My classmates and I only say the Journal article and texbook assigned reading. 

I preferred reading the aricle by Roberts & Gavery because it provided a foundation for why the computational work we are learning in class is relevant to research. I also enjoyed getting a refresher on my genetic and molecular biology knowledge. Whereas the textbook reading was very dry. Although the information on the texbook is relevant and useful, it is less interesting than the journal article. 

d)  **What is your favorite thing about markdown and why?**
I like that markdown separates chunks of code because it helps me stay organized. 
e) **What is the differnce between `curl` and `wget`? When would you used one over the other?

Both commands are used to download data available online. Curl has a wider range of file types it can download (HTTP, FTPS, SFTP, ect.) as opposed to wget. The strength of wget is that it can download files recursively. If I knew that I needed to download a multitude of files related to each other at once, I would use wget. I would use curl if I wanted to download files that wget cannot download such as an SFTP.
