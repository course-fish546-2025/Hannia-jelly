Week 04 Questions

What is tmux and how does this relate to our current way of working on raven?

tmux stands for terminal multiplexer and it is a command that prevents hangups from interrupting applications that 
take a lot of time to run. So even if network connection is lost, the application will not stop running. 

What is ssh and what would the code be you would type if you were going to ssh into raven?
ssh stands for 'secure shell'. 

Code: ssh hannia@klone.hyak.uw.edu. 

What has been the most challenging part of your research project? Are you happy with your organization skills? If not what could be improved?

The most challenging part is having to navigate the data I have. Although there are instructions on how to complete some stuff like the data QC through  FastQC, I have had to do my own research to try to understand data that I did not collect. I think
it would be easier to move through the project if I had collected the data on my own. I think my organization skills are okay. Since it is the first time I am working through a project like this, I am unsure of how to set up my repository to be more organized. 

For last weeks assignment what did you appreciate the most about knitting documents?
I enjoyed the interactive data tables. They were not super difficult to do, but the results were pleasant to see.
